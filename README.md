# Odin-recipes
* This project is about practising the use of Images and Links by creating a Recipe webpage. 
* At the end of the lesson I have been able to learn and demonstrate the use of images and links by creating an Index page with links to the pages containing the recipes and I have also been able to add different images to my recipes page. 
* All this was done using the link tag `<a href=""></a>` and the image tag `<img src="" alt="">`
